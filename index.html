                <p>My darling Janice,
                </p>
                <p>Some people say that things seemed clearer when they were written down.</p>

                <p>Well, here with a very boring letter in which I will try and put something down.</p>

                <p>To begin with I love you with a depth and passion that I have felt for no one else in this life and if it astonishes you it astonishes me as well.
              </p>

                <p>It's just that, first of all,  I would not get involved with another woman.</p>

                <p>I would never have thought it possible that another human being could occupy my waking and sleeping thoughts to the exclusion of almost everything else.
              </p>

                <p>I never hoped, aspired, dreamed that one could find everything one wanted in one person.</p>

                <p>Yet in you I have found everything I want.</p>

                <p>I want nothing else in this life than to be with you, to listen and watch you, to argue with you, </p>

                <p> to laugh with you, to globetrottingto with you, to take photos for you. show you things and share things with you,</p>

                <p>to explore your magnificent mind, to help you, protect you, serve you,</p>

                <p>and bash you on the head when I think you are wrong â€¦</p>

                <p>Everything I want to do with you.</p>
                <p>No matter how far apart we are, my thought always find their way back to you.</p>
              
                <p>Summer for thee, grant I may be.
                </p>
              
              <p>
               Love always, </p>

                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  Nov.15th, 2019</p>
